# Machine learning projects/learning
## Goals:
### implement linear regression from scratch
- In order to understand basic prediction models that some machine learning algorithms/models use
### implement gradient descent from scratch
- In order to learn how to minimize errors from prediction models
### implement "NEAT" from scratch into some project from Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikulainen
- Could be a fun project since I can see an evolving neural network get closer and closer to completing a goal with each generation without having to manually train it
### implement "Attention Is All You Need" from scratch into some project from Google Engineers
- In order to learn and deeply understand the transformer model that is used in some large language models such as chatgpt
