# Linear Regression Multiple Ways From Scratch
## Description
There are many methods used to solve linear regression. I will be implementing the following methods from scratch:
1. Simple linear regression
2. Ordinary least squares
3. Gradient descent

## Uses
Good for analyzing relationships between 2 or more variables, as well as predicting the value of some variable you want based on other variables. Data should have a correlation coefficient of |r| >= .5 to be useful.
