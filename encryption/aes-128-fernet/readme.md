# Encryption Program With GUI
## About this project
This project is an encryption program using AES-128 bit encryption in Python. I used the fernet method from the cryptography library and made a basic GUI to make it easy to use. The GUI has 3 buttons which are decrypt for decrypting files, encrypt for
encrypting files, and generate key for making an encryption key used for encrypting and decrypting. This was my first time ever making a GUI of any kind, but I learned a lot from it.
